title: Invoices settings

The Settings > Invoices section allows you to configure key invoice-related details.

By clicking "Default" (upper right) and selecting "New Invoicing Entity," you can create an additional invoicing entity. You'll need to enter:

* **Name** â€“ Used internally in Meteroid (only the name in Settings > Merchant appears on invoices sent to customers).
* **Incorporation country** â€“ Determines the default currency in which this invoicing entity will bill. You can always change the currency for a specific plan by going to Product Catalog > Currency.

In Settings > Invoices, you can also update the following settings:

* **Invoice number pattern** â€“ Defines how invoice numbers appear in Billing > Invoices.
* **Grace period** â€“ The time frame before an invoice is considered finalized and officially due.
* **Net terms** â€“ The number of days customers have to pay their invoice.

ðŸ“Œ **Priority Rule**: If **Net Terms** are defined at the **Plan level** (in **Product Catalog > Plan**), they will override the Net Terms of the invoicing entity. Otherwise, the default Net Terms from the invoicing entity apply.

* **Invoice footer** â€“ Space for additional or legal information, which appears at the bottom of invoices. This could include: headquarters address, legal registration number, juridical status (e.g., SAS, GmbH, Ltd.), VAT number or any other compliance-required text.

ðŸ“Œ **Best Practice:** If a Customers' **billing address** (under **Customers > Billing Address**) is located in **France**, the invoice will automatically be issued in **French**. For all other Customers, invoices are issued in **English**. To ensure clarity and compliance across Customer geographies, consider writing your **invoice footnotes in both English and French**.
