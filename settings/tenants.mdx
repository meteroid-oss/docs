Meteroid allows you to manage multiple environments through Tenants. To create a new Tenant, click Tenant (upper right) > New Tenant.

When creating a Tenant, you can choose from three types of environments:

* **Production** â€“ Your live environment, connected to real Customers and payment providers.
* **Development** â€“ A test environment to simulate your setup.

ðŸ’¡ You cannot connect a Stripe account in Development mode.

* **Sandbox** â€“ A pre-filled demo environment with fake data, ideal to explore how Meteroid works.

In **Settings > General**, you can further personalize each Tenantâ€™s settings:

* **Company Trade Name** â€“ This name is used within the Platform but does not appear on invoices. To update invoice details, go to Settings > Merchant.
* **Tenant Name** â€“ You can modify this field as needed. To create a new tenant, go to **Tenant > New Tenant** (upper left).
* **Tenant Slug** â€“ Customize the tenant slug name. Different tenant types (e.g., Production, Staging, Development, QA) can be created for various use cases.

ðŸ’¡ Only changes in Production Tenants affect End Users and financial transactions.

* **Reporting Currency** â€“ This currency is used exclusively for reporting and dashboards presented in the Reports section. It does not affect Plans & Invoices.

ðŸ“Œ Note: Only Customers are shared across Tenants. All other data (Plans, Subscriptions, Metrics, Invoices, etc.) is Tenant-specific and cannot be accessed across environments.


# Merchant

In the **Settings > Merchant** section, you can update your billing details.

Click the double arrow in the upper right to create a new invoicing entity. By default, the billing entity created during account setup will be used.

You can modify all information visible on client invoices, including your legal name, address (Address Line 1 & 2, City, State, ZIP Code, Country), VAT number, and logo.

For example, your billing information will be formatted as:\
Acme Inc. \[Legal name]\
123 Main Street \[Adress line 1]\
Suite 456 \[Adress line 2]\
Los Angeles, CA 90001 \[City, State, ZIP Code]\
United States \[Country]

ðŸ’¡Note:

* The uploaded logo will appear on the invoice, the checkout page, and in the Customer Portalâ€”a dedicated section within your web application where Customers can manage their Subscription, Payments, and billing information.
* The accounting currency is the currency used to record your transactions. It is determined by your billing country and cannot be changed once set. To bill in a different currency, you must create a new invoicing entity based in the corresponding country.
