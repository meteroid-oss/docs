title: Supported Payment Method
---

In Meteroid, payment methods are managed at the **Invoicing Entity** level. To edit payment methods navigate Settings > Payment methods

📌 Tip: To add a new invoicing entity, navigate to **Settings > Merchant** and click **"New Invoicing Entity"**.

Meteroid supports multiple payment options:

* **Credit Card**: Requires connection to a supported PSP (Payment Service Provider e.g. Stripe), that can be edited in Settings > Integrations. Meteroid provides a hosted check out portal to allow End Users manage their preferred payment method, which is secruely stored by the PSP and used in future payment flows.
* **Direct Debit / SEPA**: Idem Credit Card
* **Bank Transfer**: You must select a bank account. If required, to add a bank account:
  * Click **“Add bank account”**
  * Fill in the required details (bank name, IBAN, BIC, etc.)

📌 **Additional Rules**: 
* If you **define multiple payment methods**, you can choose which one applies for a given Customer when creating a subscription (*cf*. creating a subscription section).
* If credit card and direct debit are set, end users can choose their preferred method at checkout.
