ðŸ“Œ **Note**:
- Meteroid uses the intra-community VAT number or Tax ID to classify a Customer as either Business-to-Business (BtB) or Business-to-Consumer (BtC). If no intra-community VAT number is filled, Meteroid classifies the Customer as BtC.
- For international BtB customers, the invoice will automatically include relevant mentions like for the reverse charge mechanism.
