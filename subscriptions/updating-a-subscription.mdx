title: Updating a subscription
---

For subscriptions using a **seat-based pricing model**, you can update the number of seats at any time during the life of the subscription. To do so:

* Go to **Subscriptions**
* Select the subscription you want to modify
* Click on the **⇅** icon
* Add or remove seats as needed

Once the number of seats has been updated, an invoice is issued

💡 **Note**: the new seat count can take effect either:

* Immediately: the number of active seats is updated right away and the updated seat count is used for future invoices
* After payment: The seat count will be updated only after the Customer pays the upcoming invoice. Until then, the former number of seats remains active

💡 **Note**: by clicking the 🕓 icon, you can see previous and upcoming seat change for a given subscription
