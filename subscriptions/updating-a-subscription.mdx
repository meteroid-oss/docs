## Billing Settings Updates  

You can update the billing settings of an existing Subscription by navigating to the desired Subscription and clicking **Actions > Edit billing settings**.

From there, you can update the following elements:

- **Payment method strategy:** You can change how the Customer is expected to pay (for example, credit card, direct debit, bank transfer etc). This change is reflected at the Invoice level in the Customer Portal or when sharing a payment link for example.
- **Charge automatically:** If the Subscription uses an online payment method such as credit card or direct debit, you can enable or disable automatic charging.
- **Auto-advance invoices:** You can control whether Invoices automatically move from **Draft** to **Finalized** after the Grace Period, or remain in Draft until manually finalized.
- **Net terms:** You can update the payment due terms (for example, Net 15, Net 30). This defines the Invoice due date relative to its issuance date.
- **Purchase Order number:** You can add or update the Purchase Order number associated with the Subscription. This value will be displayed on all future Invoices generated from this Subscription.

## Seats updates

For subscriptions using a **seat-based pricing model**, you can update the number of seats at any time during the life of the subscription. To do so:

* Go to **Subscriptions**
* Select the subscription you want to modify
* Click on the **⇅** icon
* Add or remove seats as needed

Once the number of seats has been updated, an invoice is issued

💡 **Note**: the new seat count can take effect either:

* Immediately: the number of active seats is updated right away and the updated seat count is used for future invoices
* After payment: The seat count will be updated only after the Customer pays the upcoming invoice. Until then, the former number of seats remains active

💡 **Note**: by clicking the 🕓 icon, you can see previous and upcoming seat change for a given subscription
