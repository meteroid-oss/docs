title: Check-out
description: Meteroid provides a **hosted check-out page** that lets your End Users subscribe and complete purchases securely.
---


When assigning a Subscription, you can create a checkout sessionâ€”this generates a shareable public page where End Users can:

* Review their subscription details (e.g., plan, pricing)
* Enter their billing information
* Select a payment method
* Complete the purchase

The checkout page is optimized for seamless payments and supports multiple payment methods, including credit cards, direct debits, and bank transfers. You can enable one or multiple methods based on your preferences in the payment settings (Settings > Payment Methods).

Once the Subscription is confirmed, Meteroid will automatically update the subscription status and billing informationâ€”ensuring a smooth, real-time experience for both Account Managers and End Users.

ðŸ“Œ Payments are processed by your chosen Payment Service Provider (PSP) and not by Meteroid. Meteroid supports integrations with providers such as Stripe to handle payment execution.
