title: Managing Subscriptions
---

To manage subscriptions in Meteroid, navigate to the **Billing** section. Here, you'll see all your current and past subscriptions, along with their status. The possible statuses are:

* **Canceled**: The subscription has been terminated and will no longer generate charges. Customer's access to the subscribed plan is revoked. This status can only be set manually by Account Managers.
* **Expired**: The subscription has reached its defined end date and is no longer active. Your Customer is no longer billed, and access to the subscribed plan is revoked. By default, Customers reaching the expiration date of a paying plan are downgraded to the Free Plan (if existing). An alert is triggered to the Account manager one month before the expiration date. This status is set automatically.
* **Pending**: The subscription has been created but is waiting for activation (cf. below). The Customer does not yet have access to the service/product provided by the Account Manager. This status can be set manually too by Account Managers if they want to pause a subscription.
* **Active**: The subscription is currently running, and the Customer accesses the services/product offered by the Account Manager. The Customers are billed according to the pricing defined in the subscribed Plan. This status is set automatically at the lattest date between (i) the subscription activation date and (ii) the payment date. It can be set manually too by the Account Manager.
