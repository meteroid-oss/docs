title: Managing Subscriptions
---

To manage subscriptions in Meteroid, go to the **Billing > Subscriptions** section. Here, you’ll find all current and past subscriptions with their associated statuses:

* **Pending Activation**: The subscription has a start date in the future. It is scheduled but not yet active. No billing occurs until activation.
* **Pending Charge**: The subscription is awaiting payment before becoming active. Once the first payment is confirmed, the subscription is activated.
* **Trial Active**: The subscription is currently in a trial period. No charges are issued during this time.
* **Trial Expired**: The trial period has ended, and the Customer has not subscribed to a paid plan.
* **Active**: The subscription is live. The customer is billed according to the pricing defined in the subscribed plan. This status is set automatically at the **later of** (i) the subscription’s activation date, or (ii) the payment confirmation date. It can also be set manually by Account Managers.
* **Suspended**: The subscription has encountered a payment failure (e.g., unsuccessful retries via credit card or direct debit).

💡 Note: Meteroid does not currently enforce entitlement revocation—access is not automatically cut off—but billing retries continue.

* **Cancelled**: The subscription was manually terminated and will no longer generate charges.
* **Completed**: The subscription has reached its predefined end date and is now inactive. No further billing occurs. By default, customers reaching the end of a paid plan are downgraded to the Free Plan (if available). Meteroid triggers an alert to the Account Manager **one month before expiration**. This status is set **automatically**.
* **Superseded**: A new subscription has replaced this one, due to a self-serve plan change (e.g., upgrade, downgrade) or Plan migration. The old subscription is marked as **superseded** and no longer billed.
* **Paused** *(Coming Soon)*: This will be a manual action. A paused subscription is not billed during the pause period, and once resumed, the remaining duration continues from where it was left. For example, pausing a 12-month plan at month 3 means 9 months remain when resumed.
