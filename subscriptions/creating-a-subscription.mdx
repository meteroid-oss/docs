title: Creating a subscription
---

A Subscription can be created either manually by Account Managers directly in Meteroid, or automatically when End Users subscribe through their Portal. In both cases, the Subscription is recorded in Meteroid.

To create a subscription manually:

* Go to Billing > Subscription and click **"+ New Subscription"**.
* Choose a **Plan** from your existing Product Catalog. You can use the Pricing section to customize the pricing inherited from the Plan.

ðŸ’¡When assigning a subscription, customizing the information inherited from the Plan does not affect the original Plan.

* Assign the plan to a **Customer** by selecting one from the list.
* Set the **Start Date** using the **"From Date"** field. If needed, define an **End Date** with the **"To Date"** field. If no End Date is set, the Subscription will continue indefinitely until it is canceled.

ðŸ’¡If the Start Date is set in the future, the Subscription will remain in **Pending** status until that date is reached **and** the payment is successfully processed. Once these conditions are met, the Subscription will automatically move to \*\*Active \*\*(cf. Managing Subscriptions). When an End Date is defined, the Subscription will automatically transition to **Expired** status once that date is reached.

* Choose a **Billing Cycle**:
  * **1<sup>st</sup> of the month**: Customers will be charged each billing period (e.g monthly) the 1<sup>st</sup> of the month.

    ðŸ’¡For the first Invoice, the Customer will be charged for the full month, even if they subscribed mid-month.

  * **Anniversary date of the Subscription**: Customers will be charged each billing period (e.g monthly) at the Subscription's anniversary date.
