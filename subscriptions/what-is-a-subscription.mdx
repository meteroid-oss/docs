title: What is a subscription ?
---

In Meteroid, **a subscription connects a Customer to a specific Plan**, specifying what products or services they can access and how they are charged.

Subscriptions can start immediately or be scheduled to begin in the future. Similarly, cancellations can take effect instantly or be scheduled for a later date. A Customer can have one or multiple subscriptions active at the same time. As Invoices are handled at the subscription level, a Customer will receive a separate Invoice for each Subscription.

Meteroidâ€™s flexible subscription model allows you to manage different payment cadences, renewal rules, and make changes easily as your business or Customers' needs evolve.
