Quotes in Meteroid give your Sales team the ability to manage custom deals while keeping Finance in sync. Thanks to CPQ (Configure, Price, Quote), you can streamline the process of negotiating and closing deals without manual handovers.

The benefits are twofold:

* **Close custom deals faster** – Sales can configure personalized offers directly in Meteroid.
* **Automated downstream process** – Once a Quote is signed, Meteroid automatically creates a Subscription, and the Customer is billed accordingly. This ensures zero friction between Sales and Finance.
