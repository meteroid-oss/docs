## Create a Quote

To create a new Quote, go to **Billing > Quotes** and click **+ Create Quote.**

Steps:

1. **Choose a Customer and a Plan.**
2. **Fill in the Quote details:**

   * **Subscription Start Date**: Can be set in the past or future. This determines when the Subscription linked to the Quote will activate.
   * **Billing Day**: Defines the day of the billing period when the Customer will be billed. For example, if set to “5” and the billing cycle is monthly, the Customer will be billed on the 5th of each month. By default, it is set to the Subscription’s anniversary date.
   * **Recipient(s):** Choose who should receive and sign the Quote. If you select multiple recipients, the Quote will only be considered accepted once **all recipients** have signed.

Once the required fields are complete, click **Create Quote** in the upper right.

* Quotes are created in **Draft** status by default.
* To move the Quote to **Pending** status and send it to recipients, click **Actions > Publish Quote.**

If needed, you can resend the Quote to Customers by:

* Clicking **Actions > Send to Customer**
* Clicking **Actions > Generate portal link**
* Copy-pasting the portal link from the Recipient section and sending it manually.

Once signed by all recipients, the Quote will move to the **Accepted** status.

## Signature

Meteroid provides a built-in signature feature. The recipient simply enters their name and signs in the dedicated section to validate the Quote.

💡 **Note**: Meteroid's built-in signature featrue \*\*does not have probative legal value \*\*but serves as a lightweight, easy-to-use confirmation step.

📌 **Note:** Meteroid is continuously expanding its integration library to better support your workflows. If your organization requires integration with a third-party e-signature provider that is not currently available, feel free to contact us at 👉 [**hey@meteroid.com**](https://docs.meteroid.com/integrations/general-information#)

## Manage Quotes

In **Billing > Quotes**, you’ll find an overview of all created Quotes, along with their current status (Draft, Pending, Accepted). This gives your team full visibility on deal progress and pending customer actions.
