## Create a Quote

To create a new Quote, go to **Billing > Quotes** and click **+ Create Quote.**

Steps:

1. **Choose a Customer and a Plan.**
2. **Fill in the Quote details:**
3. **Subscription Settings:** If enabled, Meteroid will automatically create a Subscription once the Quote is signed by all the required recipients (*cf*. below). For more details (*e.g* susbcription dates, billing configuration), refer to the Creating a Subscription section.

💡 **Note**: If disabled, Account Managers can always create a subscription from a specific quote by clicking Actions > convert to subscription.

4. **Recipient(s):** Choose who should receive and sign the Quote. If you select multiple recipients, the Quote will only be considered accepted once **all recipients** have signed.

Once the required fields are complete, click **Create Quote** in the upper right.

* Quotes are created in **Draft** status by default.
* To move the Quote to **Pending** status and send it to recipients, click **Actions > Publish Quote.**

If needed, you can resend the Quote to Customers by:

* Clicking **Actions > Send to Customer**
* Clicking **Actions > Generate portal link**
* Clicking on a given quote and copy-pasting the portal link from the Recipient section and sending it manually.

Once signed by all recipients, the Quote will move to the **Accepted** status.

## Signature

Meteroid provides a built-in signature feature. The recipient simply enters their name and signs in the dedicated section to validate the Quote.

💡 **Note**: Meteroid's built-in signature featrue \*\*does not have probative legal value \*\*but serves as a lightweight, easy-to-use confirmation step.

📌 **Note:** Meteroid is continuously expanding its integration library to better support your workflows. If your organization requires integration with a third-party e-signature provider that is not currently available, feel free to contact us at 👉 [**hey@meteroid.com**](https://docs.meteroid.com/integrations/general-information#)

## Manage Quotes

In **Billing > Quotes**, you’ll find an overview of all created Quotes, along with their current status (Draft, Pending, Accepted). This gives your team full visibility on deal progress and pending customer actions.
