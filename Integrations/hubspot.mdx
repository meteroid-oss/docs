title: HubSpot Integration
---

HubSpot is a leading CRM platform offering powerful tools for marketing, sales, content management, and customer service.

With **Meteroidâ€™s native integration**, you can automatically sync your data to HubSpot, ensuring alignment between your sales and finance teams. The integration enables synchronization for changes in:

* Your **customers**
* Your **subscriptions**

Meteroid-HubSpot is a **one-way integration** from Meteroid to HubSpot. When new customers or subscriptions are created in Meteroid, they are **automatically synced** to HubSpot.

ðŸ’¡ **Important:** Only customers and subscriptions created *after* the integration is enabled will be automatically synced. Existing data in Meteroid is not retroactively propagated to HubSpot.

## Prerequisites

To enable the integration, your HubSpot account must be on the **Sales Hub Enterprise** plan. This is required to support custom objects and fields, which Meteroid uses to store billing data.

## Data Mapping

### Customers

When a new customer is created in Meteroid, it is pushed as a **Company record** in HubSpot. The following fields are mapped:

| Company property in Hubspot   | Property in Meteroid                  |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| id                            | customer â†’ id                         |
| name                          | customer â†’ name                       |
| meteroid\_customer\_id          | customer â†’ id                         |
| meteroid\_customer\_email       | customer â†’ billing\_email              |
| meteroid\_customer\_country     | customer â†’ billing\_address â†’ country  |
| meteroid\_customer\_city        | customer â†’ billing\_address â†’ city     |
| meteroid\_customer\_state       | customer â†’ billing\_address â†’ state    |
| meteroid\_customer\_street      | customer â†’ billing\_address â†’ line1    |
| meteroid\_customer\_postal\_code | customer â†’ billing\_address â†’ zip\_code |

ðŸ“Œ Note: Hubspot properties prefixed with `meteroid_` are custom-created properties under `Meteroid information` property group.

### Subscriptions

Meteroid subscriptions are synced and associated with the corresponding HubSpot Deal. The following fields are created or updated:

| Deal property in Hubspot         | Property in Meteroid       |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| id                               | subscription â†’ id          |
| dealname                         | plan â†’ name                |
| meteroid\_customer\_id             | subscription â†’ customer\_id |
| meteroid\_subscription\_id         | subscription â†’ id          |
| meteroid\_subscription\_plan       | plan â†’ name                |
| meteroid\_subscription\_start\_date | subscription â†’ start\_date  |
| meteroid\_subscription\_end\_date   | subscription â†’ end\_date    |
| meteroid\_subscription\_currency   | subscription â†’ currency    |
| meteroid\_subscription\_status     | subscription â†’ status      |
| meteroid\_subscription\_mrr\_cents  | subscription â†’ mrr\_cents   |

ðŸ“Œ Note: Hubspot properties prefixed with `meteroid_` are custom-created properties under `Meteroid information` property group.
