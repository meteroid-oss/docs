## Create a Credit Note

Credit notes can only be created from **finalized invoices**, regardless of their payment status.
To create one, go to **Billing > Invoices**, open the relevant invoice, then click **Actions > Create Credit Note**.

## Credit Note Types

When creating a credit note, you can choose between two options:

* **Credit to Customer Balance**, the credited amount is added to the Customer’s balance and will automatically be applied to future **recurring invoices**.

💡**Note:** This balance is not used for manually created invoices.

💡**Note: ** This balance is credited even if the associated invoice's payment status is unpaid or partially paid.

* **Refund**, the credit note indicates that the Customer should be refunded.

💡**Note:** Refunds are only available for paid or partially paid invoices.

💡**Note:** Refunds are **not handled by Meteroid** and must be processed on your side. Meteroid only records the credit note for accounting and tracking purposes.

## Managing Credit Notes

All issued credit notes can be found in **Billing > Credit Notes**, where you get an overview of their amount, status, associated invoice, and Customer.
