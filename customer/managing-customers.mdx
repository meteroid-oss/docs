* **Alias (External ID):** The Customer’s unique identifier in your system.
* **Stripe Customer ID:** If using Stripe for credit card payments, you can link an existing Stripe customer ID for seamless payment processing. *(Note: Meteroid currently only supports Stripe for payment processing.)*

Once created, you can update Customer details:
