# Creating a New Customer

To create a new Customer, go to **Customers > New Customer**. You will then need to enter the following details:

* **Invoicing entity:** The invoicing entity you want to use to bill this Customer
* **Customer Name:** The name of the Customer. This name will be used to create Invoices.
* **Alias (External ID):** The Customer’s unique identifier in your system.
* **Email address:** The contact email your Sales team use to contact Customers. This email is not used by Meteroid.
* **Invoicing email:** The email you want Meteroid to use to send invoices to your Customers.
* **VAT number:** This field must be filled if you want to use Meteroid VAT tax engine.
* **Custom taxes:** This field must be filled if you want to apply custom tax rates or apply a tax rate outside of the EU.
* **Billing Address:** This will appear on Invoices.
* **Shipping Address:** If applicable.

Once created, you can connect a customer to external providers by clicking "manage" in the integrations section. For example, if you use Stripe for credit card payments, you can link there an existing Stripe customer ID to a Customer created in Meteroid for seamless payment processing.


📌 **Note:** If *“Disable all email notifications”* is enabled in Settings > General, no business emails (*e.g* invoicing, payment emails) will be sent to Customers.
