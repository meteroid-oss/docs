The **Customer Portal** is a self-service interface where your Customers can independently manage their subscriptions, payment methods, invoices, and billing information—without requiring manual intervention from your team.

# What can Customers do in the Portal?

## Payment Method Management

Customers can add or update their payment methods directly from the Portal depending on the payment methods configured at the **invoicing entity level** in **Settings > Payment Methods**.

For example: If **Credit Card** is enabled with Stripe for the invoicing entity, the Customer can add a credit card. If not, they cannot.

💡 **Note**: Whenever the Customer adds a new payment method, it automatically becomes their **default** method for future payments.

## Update Billing Details

Customers can update directly in the Portal their billing info (email, billing adress, tax number...). They updated information are automatically reflected in Meteroid and applied to future invoices.

## Manage Invoices & Subscriptions

Customers can access their subscription details and view and download their invoices.
