title: Pennylane Integration
---

## Overview

PennylaneÂ is a leading French financial and accounting management solution, available as SaaS.

With **Meteroidâ€™s native integration**, you can automatically sync to Pennylane, ensuring alignment with your accounting system. The integration enables synchronization for changes in:

* **Customers**
* **Invoices**

Meteroid-Pennylane is a **one-way integration** from Meteroid to Pennylane. When new Customers or Invoices are created in Meteroid, they are **automatically synced** to Pennylane.

ðŸ’¡ **Important:** Only changes occuring *after* the integration is enabled will be automatically synced. Previously existing data in Meteroid is not retroactively propagated to Pennylane.

## Prerequisites

To enable the integration, your Pennylane account must be on the **Essential** or **Premium** plan, which includes support for third-party integrations.

## Data Mapping

Meteroid exports invoices to Pennylane with the following fields:
