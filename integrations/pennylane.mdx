title: Pennylane Integration
---

## Overview

Pennylane is a leading French financial and accounting management solution, available as SaaS.

With **Meteroid’s native integration**, you can automatically sync to Pennylane, ensuring alignment with your accounting system. The integration enables synchronization for changes in:

* **Customers**
* **Invoices**

Meteroid-Pennylane is a **one-way integration** from Meteroid to Pennylane. When new Customers or Invoices are created in Meteroid, they are **automatically synced** to Pennylane.

💡 **Important:** Only changes occuring *after* the integration is enabled will be automatically synced. Previously existing data in Meteroid is not retroactively propagated to Pennylane.

## Prerequisites

To enable the integration, your Pennylane account must be on the **Essential** or **Premium** plan, which includes support for third-party integrations.

## Data Mapping

### Customer 

When a new Customer is created in Meteroid, Meteroid updates the Sales > Customers section in Pennylane. The following fields are mapped: 

| Pennylane                                     | Meteroid                                              |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| name                            | name                                                    |
| billing_address                                | billing_address                                        |
| phone                                          | phone                                          |
| external_reference                                      | customer_id |
| vat_number                                      | vat_number                                              |
| emails                      | invoicing_emails                                 |
| billing_iban       | null                               |

💡 Important: For Customers to be successfully synced to Pennylane:
- The VAT number must have a valid format (*e.g* FRXX123456789).
- The Phone number must have a valid format (*e.g* +33612345678).
