Managing events
---

In the **Events** section, you can review the latest events sent to Meteroid, whether they were ingested through the API or imported via CSV. This gives you full visibility into the raw data that powers your billable metrics.

💡 **Note:** Events remain visible in the preview section for **30 days**.

## Import Events via CSV

You can bulk import events into Meteroid by clicking **“Import CSV.”** The imported CSV file must include the following mandatory fields:

* **event\_code**: This field will later be used when creating a billable metric (corresponds to the Event Code when creating a new Billable Metric).
* **customer\_id**: Used to link the event to a Customer in Meteroid. The link is established through the **Alias** defined in the Customer record.
