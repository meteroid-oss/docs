title: Get strated with Meteroid 
---

Whether you're exploring Meteroid for the first time or preparing for deployment, we recommend the following steps to test and validate your setup safely and efficiently.

## 1. Create Your Meteroid Account

To begin, create an account on Meteroid. This gives you access to the billing platform and the tools needed to manage subscriptions, invoicing, and payments.

## 2. Choose a Safe Testing Environment

We **strongly recommend** testing in a non-production setup before going live. You have two options:

* Use a **Development Environment**: Ideal for custom setups or teams integrating Meteroid into their internal stack
* Use the **Sandbox Environment (with sample data)**: Meteroid offers a preconfigured Sandbox environment populated with mock data to help you visualize how Meteroid can help your business

To ensure you are in the right environment (also called **tenants**), go to Settings > General and look at the Tenant slug section (which can be "dev" ie. Development Environment, "sandbox" ie. Sandbox Environment or "prod ie. Production Environment).

If required, you can create at any time new tenants by clicking "new tenant".

## 3. Set Up Your Invoicing Entity & Payment Methods

To ensure accurate testing or going live, make sure your **invoicing setup is complete**:

* **Invoicing Entity Details**
  Go to Settings > Merchant and ensure all billing information is accurate. This will be reflected on all generated invoices.
* **Connect to a Payment Provider**
  If required, connect Meteroid to your preferred payment provider in Settings > Integrations. Meteroid currently supports providers like **Stripe**.
* **Define Payment Methods**
  Go to Settings > Payment Methods and choose the options available to your customers (Credit Card, Direct Debit, or Bank Transfer).

## 4. Create Your First Subscriptions and Invoices

Once your environment and billing setup are ready, you're good to go with your first usage simulation:

1. **Create Metrics** *(if your pricing model is usage-based)* via **Product Catalog > Metrics**
2. **Create Plans** under **Product Catalog > Plans** with desired pricing, trial, and billing configuration
3. **Add Customers** in the **Customers** tab
4. **Assign Plans to Customers** by creating a **Subscription** from the **Billing > Subscriptions** tab
5. **View and Manage Invoices** in **Billing > Invoices**, where Meteroid automatically generates invoices based on the subscription
