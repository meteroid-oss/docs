## Deployment

Meteroid does not offer yet an official distribution package. <br/>
For now, you need to clone the repository and install the dependencies (you can follow the developer guide in the repository), or contact us for a custom image.

There is a custom docker-compose file in the repository, but it is not yet officially supported.


We aim to release our official distributions soon.

Meteroid will also be available as a Cloud service.
