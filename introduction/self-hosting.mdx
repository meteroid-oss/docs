## Deployment

*Meteroid does not offer yet an official distribution package.*


For now, you need to clone the repository and install the dependencies (you can follow the developer guide in the repository), use the custom docker-compose file in the repository, or contact us for a custom image.

We aim to release our official distributions in the close future.


[Get in touch](https://meteroid.com/talk-to-us) for a demo !

<Note>
  Meteroid will also be available as a Cloud service. Projected for early Q3 2024 !
