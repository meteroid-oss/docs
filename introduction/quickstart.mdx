## Deployment

Meteroid does not offer yet an official distribution package. <br/>
For now, you need to clone the repository and install the dependencies.

You can follow the devloper guide in the repository.

We aim to release our first Docker distribution soon, and a k8s chart shortly after.

Meteroid will also be available as a Cloud service.
