## Trials

Trials allow you to grant temporary access to a Plan or to additional features before regular billing starts. In Meteroid, trials are configured directly at the **Plan level**.

### Configuring a Trial

To configure a trial, go to **Product Catalog > Plans**, open the relevant Plan, and scroll down to the **Trial** section. From there, you can define the trial duration, the Plan the trial applies to, and what happens once the trial ends.Trials only apply **at the beginning of a subscription**. If you add or modify a trial on an existing Plan, it will create a new version of the Plan and only **new Customers subscribing to that Plan** will benefit from the trial. Existing subscriptions are not retroactively affected.

### Trial Duration and Billing Alignment

If you grant **14 days of free trial**, start the subscription on **January 1st**, and choose to bill on the **subscription anniversary date**, the first invoice will be issued on **January 15th**, and the Customer will then be billed every **15th of the month** (for a monthly billing cycle). If instead you choose to bill on the **first day of the month**, the Customer will receive a **pro-rated invoice on January 15th**, covering the period from January 15th to January 31st, and will then be billed every **1st of the month** thereafter.

### Trials and Usage

Trials affect both **subscription charges and usage-based charges**. Any usage generated during the trial period follows the trial rules defined for the Plan and will not be billed if the trial is free.

### Granting Access to Another Plan During a Trial

Meteroid allows you to grant trial access to another Plan’s features while keeping the subscription anchored to the original Plan. If you configure a trial on **Plan 1** that grants **90 days of access to Plan 2 features while continuing to charge**, Customers will be billed according to **Plan 1’s pricing and billing conditions**. This setup is useful when Plan 2 offers more advanced features that you want Customers to experience before potentially upgrading. If you configure a trial on **Plan 1** that grants **90 days of access to Plan 2 features for free**, Customers will **not be charged at all** during the trial period (neither for Plan 1 nor for Plan 2). Billing will only start once the trial ends, based on the defined end-of-trial behavior.

## Coupons

Coupons can be used to grant your customers discounts. Coupons can be offered as a fixed amount or a percentage of a given price and can be limited in time or not.

### Creating coupons

To create a new coupon, navigate to **Product Catalog > Coupons** and click on **"+ New Coupon"**. Then, fill in the following details:

* **Code**: The discount code that will be sent to the client. You can customize it as needed.
* **Description**: An internal note for reference (optional).
* **Discount Type**: Choose between:
  * **Fixed Amount**: A specific discount amount.
  * **Percentage**: A percentage discount applied to the total subscription cost.
* **Discount Value**: Enter the discount amount and currency (for fixed discounts) or the percentage (for percentage-based discounts).
* **Expiration Date** (optional): Set a date after which the coupon will no longer be valid.
* **Redemption Limit** (optional): Restrict the number of times the coupon can be used.

### Managing coupons

Once a coupon is created, you can manage it by clicking on the coupon and selecting "Actions". The available actions are:

* **Disable**: Temporarily deactivate the coupon, moving it to the "Inactive" section. To reactivate it, go to the "Inactive" section, select the coupon, and click "Actions" > "Enable" to restore it to the "Active" section.
* **Archive**: Move the coupon to the "Archived" section. To restore it, go to the "Archived" section, select the coupon, and click "Actions" > "Restore & Enable", making it active again.
* **Delete**: Permanently remove the coupon. Once deleted, it cannot be recovered or reused.

You can also update the coupon amount or percentage at any time. Simply click on the coupon (whether it’s in the Active, Inactive, or Archived section), enter a new value, and click Save to apply the changes.

### Applying coupons

Once you have created, coupons can be applied by:

* **End User**: Coupons can be used by End Users directly during the checkout process. They simply need to enter the coupon code at checkout to receive the discount.

💡 Coupons in Meteroid are supported at Subscription level and not yet at Customer level. To grant a coupon to a given Customer, you should discount all their subscriptions.
