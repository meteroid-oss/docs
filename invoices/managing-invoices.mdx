title: Managing invoices
---

The **Billing > Invoices** section in Meteroid provides a central view of all invoices issued to your Customers. Each invoice includes a summary of the billed items, the total amount, payment status, and key metadata such as the invoicing entity, Customer's details, and due date.

# Create new Invoices

While most invoices in Meteroid are generated automatically based on the conditions defined in your Plans (subscription pricing, usage, one-time charges, etc.), you also have the flexibility to handle ad-hoc or non-recurring events. To manually create an invoice (e.g., for one-off services not covered by a Plan), click "New Invoice" in the Billing > Invoices section.

# Edit Invoices

To **edit standard invoice elements** like footnotes, logo or legal mentions (such as VAT number, company details, or custom messaging), go to **Settings > Invoices** and update these elements for the relevant invoicing entity.

How Invoice elements are determined:

* Invoice date: Set when the invoice is finalized and sent. It‚Äôs based on the subscription's billing cycle and any applicable grace period.
* Due date: Automatically calculated using the invoice date plus the configured net payment terms.
* Bill to: Pulled directly from the Customer‚Äôs details (Name and Billing Address).


üìå Note: Generated invoices themselves are not editable once finalized, in compliance with accounting and legal requirements. If a correction is needed, consider issuing a credit note (please contact us at üëâ [**hey@meteroid.com**](#) to do so) and generating a new invoice with the updated details.

üìå Note: Meteroid supports localized invoice generation:

* If a Customer's billing address (under Customers > Billing Address) is in France, the invoice will automatically be generated in French.
* For all other end users, invoices are generated in English by default.


# Manage Invoices

Invoices in Meteroid are handled at the **Subscription level**, meaning a Customer receives a separate invoice for each Subscription.

To manage invoices, navigate to **Billing > Invoices**. There, you can view and track all invoices with the following key details:

* **Invoice Number** ‚Äì Unique identifier for each invoice
* **Customer** ‚Äì The recipient of the invoice
* **Amount & Currency** ‚Äì Total due in the relevant currency
* **Invoice Date** ‚Äì Date the invoice was issued
* **Status** ‚Äì Current state of the invoice (see below)
* **Payment Status** ‚Äì Whether or not the invoice has been paid (see below)

## Invoice Status

* **Draft: **Set automatically between the end of the billing period and the end of the grace period. The invoice is not yet finalized and is not sent to the Customer.
* **Finalized: **Unless specified, this status is set automatically at the end of the grace period. Finalized invoices are accounting documents and can no longer be edited. At this stage, if the preferred payment method is:
  * **Direct Debit or Credit Card**: If automatic payment is configured, Meteroid will charge the Customer directly and send an invoice afterwards. Otherwise, Meteroid sends a secure payment link along with the invoice, allowing the Customer to complete the payment manually.
  * **Bank Transfer**: The Customer receives the invoice along with your bank details to initiate the transfer manually.
* **Voided: **Equivalent to canceling an invoice, while preserving an audit trail. Can only be applied to finalized invoices. This action is manual.
* **Uncollectible: **Used when an invoice is considered definitively unpaid (e.g., in case of customer bankruptcy). This is a **final and irreversible status**, set manually.

## Payment Status

In addition to invoice status, Meteroid tracks **Payment Status**:

* **Unpaid: **The invoice is due and has not been paid yet.
* **Paid: **Set automatically once full payment is received. Applies to payments made via credit card or direct debit.
* **Partially Paid: **Set if only part of the total amount has been paid. <mark> </mark>
* **Errored: **Triggered after multiple failed payment attempts (e.g., declined card, insufficient funds). Typically applies to automatic payments via credit card or direct debit after all retries have failed.

üí° Note: Meteroid automatically updates the payment status if the payment method is Direct Debit or Credit Card. Meteroid does not yet support automatic payment status update for bank transfer.


# When are End Users Invoiced?

To invoice End Users in Meteroid, their Subscriptions must first be **activated** (cf. *Billing > Subscriptions*). Once active, invoicing depends on two factors:

* The **billing cycle** defined at the subscription level ‚Äî either on the **1<sup>st</sup> of the month** or on the **anniversary date** (i.e., the date the subscription started).
* The **billing period** defined for each pricing component within a Plan ‚Äî monthly, quarterly, annually, etc.

Different types of pricing components are billed at different moments within the billing period:

* **Subscription rates** and **slot-based pricing** are billed **at the beginning** of the billing period.
* **Capacity commitments** and **usage-based charges** are billed **monthly at the end** of the billing period, once actual usage or fulfillment is known.

Examples:

* If a Plan is solely composed of a subscription rate billed quarterly, and the billing cycle is set to the 1st of the month, Customers will receive an Invoice at the beginning of each quarter (e.g., January 1<sup>st</sup>, April 1<sup>st</sup>, etc.).
* In Month M, an Invoice will charge End Users for their monthly subscription rate for Month M+1 (in advance) and their usage or capacity consumption from Month M (in arrears).

# E-Invoices

#### What is e-invoicing?

**E-invoicing (electronic invoicing)** is the digital exchange of invoice documents between a supplier and a buyer, using a **standardized format** that enables automated processing. Unlike traditional PDFs or paper invoices, e-invoices follow a structured format (typically XML) that can be seamlessly interpreted by accounting systems and tax authorities.

This process is particularly important in jurisdictions like the **European Union**, where specific e-invoicing standards are mandated for businesses to comply with tax and reporting obligations.

#### E-invoices in Meteroid

Meteroid supports e-invoicing in compliance with European standards. Here‚Äôs how it works:

* Meteroid supports the **Factur-X** format, which combines a human-readable **PDF** with a machine-readable **XML** file. We currently support the **‚ÄúBasic‚Äù profile**, which is sufficient for most B2B invoicing needs.

üìå Note: By default, Meteroid issues invoices in **PDF format**. To enable e-invoicing in Factur-X format please contact us at üëâ [**hey@meteroid.com**](#)

* Depending on countries, Meteroid can **automatically send e-invoices** to your **Partenaire de D√©mat√©rialisation (PDP)** (mandatory in France as of September 2026) or directly to \*\*Tax Authorities. \*\*For more information, please contact us at üëâ [**hey@meteroid.com**](#)
