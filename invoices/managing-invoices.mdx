title: Managing invoices
---

The **Billing > Invoices** section in Meteroid provides a central view of all invoices issued to your Customers. Each invoice includes a summary of the billed items, the total amount, payment status, and key metadata such as the invoicing entity, Customer's details, and due date.

# Create new Invoices

While most invoices in Meteroid are generated automatically based on the conditions defined in your Plans (subscription pricing, usage, one-time charges, etc.), you also have the flexibility to handle ad-hoc or non-recurring events. To manually create an invoice (e.g., for one-off services not covered by a Plan), click "New Invoice" in the Billing > Invoices section.

# Edit Invoices

To **edit standard invoice elements** like footnotes, logo or legal mentions (such as VAT number, company details, or custom messaging), go to **Settings > Invoices** and update these elements for the relevant invoicing entity.

How Invoice elements are determined:

* Invoice date: Set when the invoice is finalized and sent. It‚Äôs based on the subscription's billing cycle and any applicable grace period.
* Due date: Automatically calculated using the invoice date plus the configured net payment terms.
* Bill to: Pulled directly from the Customer‚Äôs details (Name and Billing Address).

üìå Note: Generated invoices themselves are not editable once finalized, in compliance with accounting and legal requirements. If a correction is needed, consider issuing a \*\*credit note \*\*(please contact us at hey@meteroid.com to do so) and generating a new invoice with the updated details.

üìå Note: Meteroid supports localized invoice generation:

* If a Customer's billing address (under Customers > Billing Address) is in France, the invoice will automatically be generated in French.
* For all other end users, invoices are generated in English by default.


# Manage Invoices

Invoices are handled at the Subscription level, meaning a Customer will receive a separate Invoice for each Subscription. To manage Invoices, go to Billing > Invoices. Here, you can view all invoices along with key details:

* Invoice Number: Unique identifier for the Invoice.
* Customer: The recipient of the Invoice.
* Amount & Currency: The total amount due in the specified currency.
* Invoice Date: The date the Invoice was issued to the Customer.
* Status:
  * **Open**: Status of an invoice <u>before the end of the billing period</u>.
  * **Draft**: This status is set <u>between the end of the billing period and the end of the grace period</u>. During this time, the invoice is awaiting finalization and is not sent to the Customer.
  * **Canceled**:\*\* \*\*To cancel an invoice. This status can only be set to "Open" or "Draft" invoices.
  * **Finalized**: This status is set <u>after the end of the grace period</u>. Once an invoice is finalized, it is sent to the Customer using the Customer's invoicing emails
  * **Voided**: Is equivalent to canceling an invoice, yet preserving a trail. This status can only be set to "Finalized" invoices.

üí°While "Open", "Draft" and "Finalized" status are set automatically by Meteroid, "Canceled" and "Voided" status can be set manually by Account Managers.

# When are End Users Invoiced?

To invoice End Users in Meteroid, their Subscriptions must first be **activated** (cf. *Billing > Subscriptions*). Once active, invoicing depends on two factors:

* The **billing cycle** defined at the subscription level ‚Äî either on the **1**<sup>**st**</sup>\*\* of the month\*\* or on the **anniversary date** (i.e., the date the subscription started).
* The **billing period** defined for each pricing component within a Plan ‚Äî monthly, quarterly, annually, etc.

Different types of pricing components are billed at different moments within the billing period:

* **Subscription rates** and **slot-based pricing** are billed **at the beginning** of the billing period.
* **Capacity commitments** and **usage-based charges** are billed **monthly at the end** of the billing period, once actual usage or fulfillment is known.

Examples:

* If a Plan is solely composed of a subscription rate billed quarterly, and the billing cycle is set to the 1st of the month, Customers will receive an Invoice at the beginning of each quarter (e.g., January 1<sup>st</sup>, April 1<sup>st</sup>, etc.).
* In Month M, an Invoice will charge End Users for their monthly subscription rate for Month M+1 (in advance) and their usage or capacity consumption from Month M (in arrears).

# E-Invoices

#### What is e-invoicing?

**E-invoicing (electronic invoicing)** is the digital exchange of invoice documents between a supplier and a buyer, using a **standardized format** that enables automated processing. Unlike traditional PDFs or paper invoices, e-invoices follow a structured format (typically XML) that can be seamlessly interpreted by accounting systems and tax authorities.

This process is particularly important in jurisdictions like the **European Union**, where specific e-invoicing standards are mandated for businesses to comply with tax and reporting obligations.

#### E-invoices in Meteroid

Meteroid supports e-invoicing in compliance with European standards. Here‚Äôs how it works:

* Meteroid supports the **Factur-X** format, which combines a human-readable **PDF** with a machine-readable **XML** file. We currently support the **‚ÄúBasic‚Äù profile**, which is sufficient for most B2B invoicing needs.

üìå Note: By default, Meteroid issues invoices in **PDF format**. To enable e-invoicing in Factur-X format please contact us at üëâ [**hey@meteroid.com**](#)

* Depending on countries, Meteroid can **automatically send e-invoices** to your **Partenaire de D√©mat√©rialisation (PDP)** (mandatory in France as of September 2026) or directly to \*\*Tax Authorities. \*\*For more information, please contact us at üëâ [**hey@meteroid.com**](#)
